            <p class="text">
                I grew up in Bethesda Frankel Estate Church, as my parents were Christian. Throughout my teens I took the reponsibility to be serious about my faith, and tried my best to grow. I was baptised on the 14th of December, 2014. I have found many of my good friends in church and they are really great people. I found that I have really grown over the years and I'm thankful for that.</p>

                On the right is a picture of my family and I in Europe, December 2015. I have 2 older sisters, Johanna and Joelle, aged 21 and 20 respectively. My father works in Manulife as a Quality Assurance Director, while my mother is mainly a housewife, while doing other business projects with her friends on the sideline. My family are a peculiar bunch, but I still love and appreciate them anyways. They're still family, right?</p>
